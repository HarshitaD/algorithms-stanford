# Programming Assignment 5 - NP Completeness - Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)
                             
In this programming assignment we are asked to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP)

This problem may be NP-complete, but we can still address small instances, avoiding brute-forcing, and employing
the dynamic programming paradigm.
